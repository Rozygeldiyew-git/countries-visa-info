                                            <p>It is possible to apply for a visa within the Embassy. In order to do that you need to submit a filled out Visa Application Form (complete with all relevant information and a photo) to our Embassy. The Form can be downloaded from our website <em><strong>(If there is a problem with the opening the Application Form, then you have to download and save it to your files. It should open after you save)</strong>.</em> Please glue the picture rather than stapling it. As indicated, the dates should all be written in the order of day-month-year. Once your application has been filled out, you can either submit it in person (during office hours), or you can mail it&nbsp;to our address (indicated below). Please keep in mind that if there is an issue with your application you may need to resubmit it.</p>

<p>Documents that you need to provide alongside the application Form include an appropriate proof of identity (such as a personal ID or a driver’s license), as well as a valid and signed passport that is valid for at least 6 months from the date of departure. You should make a copy of the 1st page of your passport, which has been signed to be identical to the original, and arrange it so that it fits vertically into the upper left half of a standard Letter size paper. Keep in mind that the Embassy needs both the copy and the original in order to process them properly.</p>

<p>A letter of invitation from the person or company that you are visiting is also required. It’s very important to note that the letter has to be certified by the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan, and it will only be valid for 3 months from the date of certification. If you are only a tourist and will not be visiting anyone in particular, then you need to contact a tourist agency and obtain LOI&nbsp;from them. This should go without saying, but legal aliens living in the US, Canada or Mexico need to have a valid visa for return to their own countries.</p>

<p>For more information on visas, updates and useful links,&nbsp;please visit the website of the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan at <a href="http://migration.gov.tm/en/inostrannym-grazhdanam-en/">http://migration.gov.tm/en/inostrannym-grazhdanam-en/</a></p>

<p>Last, but not least, you should also submit a money order to the Embassy. The prices vary depending on several factors. For a complete list, please refer to the table below. All prices are in US dollars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>You can also obtain a visa upon arrival at the International Airport of Ashgabat. In order to do that you must provide a valid passport, as well as the original or photocopy of the valid letter of invitation from a legal or physical person, certified with the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan.</strong></p>
